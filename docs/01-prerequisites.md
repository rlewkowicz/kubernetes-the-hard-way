## Running Commands in Parallel with tmux

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) can be used to run commands on multiple compute instances at the same time. Labs in this tutorial may require running the same commands across multiple compute instances, in those cases consider using tmux and splitting a window into multiple panes with `synchronize-panes` enabled to speed up the provisioning process.

> The use of tmux is optional and not required to complete this tutorial.

> Enable `synchronize-panes`: `ctrl+b` then `shift :`. Then type `set synchronize-panes on` at the prompt. To disable synchronization: `set synchronize-panes off`.
